# Sensor Proxy

**Minimal YAML sensor proxy with full attribute inheritance.**

## Features

- Copies state + attributes from source sensor
- Inherits unit/device_class/state_class/icon  
- Optional device binding
- Optional utility meters for energy sensors (configure globally or per sensor)

> Both UI (HACS/config flow) and YAML configuration are supported for creating single entity proxies with optional utility meters.
